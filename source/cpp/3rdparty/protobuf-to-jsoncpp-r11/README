This is a simple library to convert between Google protocol buffer objects and JsonCpp objects.

The rudimentary Makefile expects that both protobuf (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) and
JsonCpp (http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) are installed in /usr/local.

The library can then be created with the following command:

$ make

A simple test application can be run with the following command:

$ make test
