libb64 examples
===============

This is a collection of simple examples describing how to use libb64.

At the moment, only the C interface is described.
The C++ interface is used in the base64/base64.cc code, if you need 
more help please read through that source.

Files
-----

- c-example1.c: shows how to encode/decode a single string
- c-example2.c: shows how to directly encode/decode a file

Note that the examples are very simple, but should illustrate the interface
usage adequately.

Targets
-------

The example code compiles using 'make all', which builds the examples 
and runs the 'test' target.
The test for c-example2.c uses diff to compare the original and decoded
data directly.

The loremgibson.txt file is a plain text containing content from

It is used in c-example2.c as the input data file.
