// Mesos executor interface and executor driver. An executor is
// responsible for launching tasks in a framework specific way (i.e.,
// creating new threads, new processes, etc). One or more executors
// from the same framework may run concurrently on the same machine.
// Note that we use the term "executor" fairly loosely to refer to the
// code that implements the Executor interface (see below) as well as
// the program that is responsible for instantiating a new
// MesosExecutorDriver (also below). In fact, while a Mesos slave is
// responsible for (forking and) executing the "executor", there is no
// reason why whatever the slave executed might itself actually
// execute another program which actually instantiates and runs the
// MesosSchedulerDriver. The only contract with the slave is that the
// program that it invokes does not exit until the "executor" has
// completed. Thus, what the slave executes may be nothing more than a
// script which actually executes (or forks and waits) the "real"
// executor.
//
// IF YOU FIND YOURSELF MODIFYING COMMENTS HERE PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING
// THE SAME MODIFICATIONS FOR OTHER LANGUAGE BINDINGS (e.g., Java:
// src/java/src/org/apache/mesos, Python: src/python/src, etc.).

// used to run this executor. The pointer will not change for the
// duration of an executor (i.e., from the point you do
